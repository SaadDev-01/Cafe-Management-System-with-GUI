Report:  Cafe Management System 
Introduction 
The Cafe Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to 
facilitate the efficient management of cafe operations. This system integrates key 
functions such as inventory management, order processing, user authentication, and 
real-time analytics, all presented through an intuitive graphical user interface built with 
Java Swing. The system ensures a user-friendly experience, helping streamline cafe 
management tasks. 
This report outlines the system’s design, core features, and functionalities, including 
detailed insights into the provided code for the Admin Login and Cafe Management 
System. 
System Overview 
The Cafe Management System consists of various modules that collectively enhance 
the efficiency of cafe operations. These modules include the Admin Login System, 
Inventory Management, Order Management, and Analytics, each offering 
functionalities aimed at simplifying administrative tasks and improving overall 
operational performance. 
The system is designed to be used by cafe for daily operations including adding 
products, managing orders, and analysing performance metrics. 
Key Features: 
• Admin Login: Secure access to the system for authorized person only. 
• Inventory Management: Allows admins to view and update product stock 
and details. 
• Order Management: Facilitates order creation, tracking, and processing. 
• Analytics: Provides detailed reports on sales performance, revenue, and 
order history. 
Functional Breakdown 
1. Admin Login Form 
The Admin Login Form serves as the entry point to the system, requiring 
authentication before granting access to core functionalities. This form validates the 
credentials of the user (admin) and ensures only authorized person can interact with 
the management system. 
Functional Details: 
• Login Interface: The login form is designed with a professional look, featuring 
a username and password input. 
• Security Mechanism: Upon input, the system verifies the credentials against 
hardcoded values. Successful login leads to the main interface, while invalid 
credentials trigger an error message. 
2. Cafe Management System 
The Cafe Management System serves as the core platform for managing cafe 
operations. The system is divided into different panels representing key aspects such 
as Inventory Management, Menu and Order Management, and Analytics. 
2.1. Inventory Management 
This module allows administrators to manage products within the cafe, including 
adding, updating, and removing items from the inventory. 
• Product Management: Admins can add new products with details such as 
name, price, stock quantity, and status (e.g., available or out of stock). 
• Inventory Table: A table displays all products in a grid, allowing for easy 
modification or deletion of records. 
Core Functionalities: 
• Add Product: A product can be added to the inventory by entering details 
such as name, price, and stock quantity. 
• Update Product: Admins can modify the details of existing products. 
• Delete Product: Items can be removed from the inventory when no longer 
needed. 
2.2. Menu and Order Management 
This module is designed to manage the cafe’s menu and handle customer orders. 
The menu dynamically reflects available items from the inventory, ensuring that only 
products in stock are available for customers to order. 
• Dynamic Menu: The system updates the menu display based on inventory 
changes. 
• Order Management: Customers can place orders, which are recorded and 
stored in the system. 
Key Functionalities: 
• Quantity Selection: The menu table allows users to select quantities for each 
item using a spinner editor. 
• Order Placement: When an order is placed, the system records the 
customer’s details and the products they’ve chosen. 
2.3. Analytics 
The analytics panel provides valuable insights into the cafe’s operational 
performance, including order history, revenue generation, and performance metrics. 
• Real-Time Analytics: Displays up-to-date statistics on sales performance 
and revenue. 
• Order History: Lists detailed orders placed, with calculations for total price. 
Core Functionalities: 
• Revenue and Order Summary: The system calculates and displays the total 
revenue and order count. 
• Order History Display: Lists all orders placed, with product names, 
quantities, and total prices. 
Code Structure and Design 
Modular Approach: 
The code for the Cafe Management System GUI is designed with a modular 
structure. Each module (login form, inventory management, menu, etc.) is self
contained, promoting code reusability and easy maintenance. 
UI Customization: 
Both the Admin Login and Cafe Management System utilize custom styling 
elements to improve user experience, such as gradient backgrounds, modern fonts, 
and hover effects. These enhancements make the application more visually 
appealing and easier to navigate. 
Event Handling and User Interaction: 
Event listeners are employed throughout the system to handle user interactions 
(e.g., button clicks, data entry). This allows the system to react dynamically to user 
input. 
Conclusion 
The Cafe Management System GUI is a well-structured and functional application 
designed to streamline cafe operations, offering modules for inventory management, 
order processing, and analytics. With secure login functionality and dynamic data 
updates, the system is ready for deployment in small to medium-sized cafe operations.
